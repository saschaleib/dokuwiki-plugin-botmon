# DokuWiki Bot Monitoring Plugin
Plugin for live-monitoring your DokuWiki instance for bot activity

#TODO: Work in progress

IMPORTANT: This is an experimental plugin to investigate bot traffic. This is not a "install and forget" software, but rather requires that you actively look at and manage the log files.

This plugin creates various log files in its own "logs" directory. These files can get quite large, and you should check them actively.

Also, these files can get quite large and fill up your server. Make sure to manually delete older files from time to time!
