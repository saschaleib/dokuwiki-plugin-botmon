# DokuWiki Bot Monitoring Plugin
Plugin for live-monitoring your DokuWiki instance for bot activity

IMPORTANT: This is an experimental plugin to investigate bot traffic. This is not a "install and forget" software, but rather requires that you actively look at and manage data for this to be useful.

In addition to collecting a lot fo information about bot activity on your server, it now also has a simple Captcha function that you can use to block off bots from downloading your precious content. It is however advisable to only activate this after you already have a better understanding of your own site's traffic patterns (both by bots and by humans) to avoid over-blocking legitimate users.

For more information, please see the DokuWiki Plugin page at: https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:botmon and the documentation found at: https://leib.be/sascha/projects/dokuwiki/botmon/index
